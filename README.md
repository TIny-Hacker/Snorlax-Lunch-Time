# Snorlax's Lunch Time

This is a port of the PokeMini "Snorlax's Lunchtime" minigame to the TI-83/84 Plus/SE, written in TI-Basic.
It will require DCS 7.2 to run. I've only tested it on DCS 7.2, so don't use something like
DCS 7.3 that isn't a public release. You can download DCS 7.2 [here](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/430/43068.html).

# Installation

1. Download and send "SNORLAX.8xp" to Archive. Send "Pic1.8xi", "Pic2.8xi", and "Pic3.8xi" to RAM.
2. Run prgmSNORLAX from either the homescreen or Doors CS.

# How to play

To navigate the menu, use [2ND] and the [UP] and [DOWN] keys.

The goal of the game is to eat the food as fast as possible. Food will fall onto Snorlax's plate from out of the sky, and you must press [2ND]
before the timer runs out. The faster you eat the food, the higher your score will be. Occasionally, however, a Pichu will fall ont Snorlax's 
plate. Don't ask how it got there, but you can't eat it. If you try to eat the Pichu, it will zap you and you will lose the game. 


#### Disclaimer

I did not make up Snorlax, Pichu, or the original idea of this game and I do not take any credit for anything other than coding it 
onto my calculator.
